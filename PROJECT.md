## Autonomous Development Strategy

### Phase 1: Understanding & Planning (Current)
1. **Analyze existing codebase:**
   - Review all files in the repository
   - Understand current architecture
   - Identify what's implemented vs planned
   - Document findings in memory files

2. **Review open issues:**
   - Check GitHub issues for priorities
   - Create local task list
   - Prioritize based on dependencies

3. **Set up development environment:**
   - Install dependencies
   - Run existing tests (if any)
   - Verify build process works

### Phase 2: Core Development
1. **Start with highest-priority features:**
   - Focus on foundational components first
   - Build one feature at a time
   - Test thoroughly before moving on

2. **Documentation as you go:**
   - Keep README updated
   - Add inline code comments
   - Document architecture decisions

3. **Git workflow:**
   - Small, focused commits
   - Clear commit messages
   - Push regularly to share progress

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement
1. **Add tests for all features**
2. **Fix bugs and improve performance**
3. **Polish documentation**
4. **Prepare for deployment**
